This is a full featured client for the webservices at
<http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de>. The script "wsws.pl" is a command
line client that uses this lib. It is contained in this distribution.

The webservices at <http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de> provide access to
a database of the german word pool. Available services include tools to
reduce words to base form, find synonyms, significant neighbours,
example sentences and more. All public services at
<http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de> are available.

=head1 INSTALLATION

The easiest is to install this module directly from CPAN using the standard
mechanism for your platform, e.g. ppm on Windows/ActiveState or the CPAN shell
on Linux.

If you want to build the module manually (which is trivial), download and unpack
the distribution, change to the created directory and type

 perl Build.PL
 perl Build
 perl Build install

This will install the Lingua::DE::Wortschatz.pm module and the command line
script wsws.pl.

Use

 perldoc wsws.pl
 perldoc Lingua::DE::Wortschatz

to get further information on usage.
